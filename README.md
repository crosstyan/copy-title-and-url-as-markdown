## Installation & Usage

### Compiling

If you are using Node.js 17 or higher, you must include `--openssl-legacy-provider` in `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable. Here is how to do it in PowerShell

[How To Fix ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED In React JS Application - Roy Tutorials](https://roytuts.com/how-to-fix-err_ossl_evp_unsupported-in-react-js-application/)

```powershell
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
```

What you need to do then is

```bash
yarn run dev-build
```

I'm not sure why but the code refuses to run with production build. (minimized code build with webpack)

If there is any error like

```bash
rm: cannot remove 'dist/*.js': No such file or directory
```

just create a dummy `.js` file in `dist` folder.

I won't publish it to Chrome Store.
